# rock2048
Training robots to crack 2048 game in basic AI algorithms.
U can try how many scores u can get in 2048 game, try this [link](http://2048game.com/).

# How to develop

Simply write your ts codes, see how ***TrainModels*** is coded, kid stuff.

Start typescript watch mode to compile your TS codes using this command below:
```js
tsc -w
```

# How to run
## Install dependencies
```js
npm i
```

## Run and see how the robot plays 2048 in the terminal
```js
node dist/main.js
```

# What I am going to do next
+ Render the 2048 game in react or other UI libs
+ Render the 2048 game in WebGL just for sum
+ Add more algorithms the achive a better performance（or just see what will happen）, such as
  + Neural Networks
  + Decision Tree
  + Genetic Algorithm
